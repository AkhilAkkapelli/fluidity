      ## Enabling this option will allow the Fluidity source code and any data files associated with this simulation to be published using the PyRDM-based 'fluidity-publish' tool. The sub-options are as follows:
      ##
      ## * 'service' selects the online repository service (e.g. Figshare) that will host the published software/data.
      ##
      ## * 'software' will be populated with the article_id and DOI once the software has been published. If the same version of the software has been published already, then the existing article_id and DOI will be entered here automatically by the fluidity-publish tool.
      ##
      ## * 'input_data/output_data' contain which input/output data files the user wishes to publish, and will be populated with the article_id and DOI once the input/output data is published. Alternatively, the user can enter an existing article_id to update the associated publication.
